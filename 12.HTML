<p>“Google” is a megacorporation and the search engine it provides. Chrome is a web browser (and an OS) made in part by Google. In other words, Google Chrome is the thing you use to look at stuff on the Internet, and Google is how you find stuff to look at.Google Chrome is a free web browser developed by Google, used for accessing web pages on the internet. As of May 2020, it is the most popular web browser of choice worldwide, with more than 60% of the web browser market share.Google Chrome comes preinstalled on most Android devices. If it's not installed for any reason, open the “Play Store” icon in your apps list by swiping up from the bottom of your screen to open your apps list.Google's Chrome browser is a privacy nightmare in itself, because all you activity within the browser can then be linked to your Google account. If Google controls your browser, your search engine, and has tracking scripts on the sites you visit, they hold the power to track you from multiple angles.</p>
